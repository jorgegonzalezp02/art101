			<h1>Lab 6: Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<p>Working with a partner, experiment with basic Javascript data types and variables.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>This lab was pretty straightforward, we didn't really run into any challenges because we just followed the code and instructions which were clear and easy to follow.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>At first, we had trouble understanding how objects and variables differed but we were able to learn with help from one of our peers.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>The output of the javascript is printed below.</p>
